Update: <a href="#har">They harassed again, very next day.</a>

## Imagine living in a lawless world. 

One fine day, you were walking through a *really* crowded place. You had a wallet. Inside it, a Rs 20 note. Someone pickpocketed you. It all happened in a flash. It was too late before you knew what happened.

Next month, the same day, you went through the exact same place. A man confronted you, blocked your way, pointed a gun on your head, took out your wallet, picked Rs 20 and escaped. You were helpless again. But this time you came to know the guy.

Come next month, the same situation occours at the same place. This time you are ready with Rs 20 in your hand. The man shows up. You hand him Rs 20.

You realize that this can not go on forever. The two things are bugging you the most  "Why is he taking money?", "How can I stop this?" 

You gather some courage and question the man.

You: Why are you taking my money forcibly?

Man: Because we had a deal. Remember? You had an agreement with my master that **you** would receive an *imported lipstick* from him every month. In return you will give me Rs 20 monthly. Like or not, I'll keep taking that amount from you.

You: Wait, WHAT?? I don't remember such an agreement and I'm not even a woman!!! Why the eff I'll need a **lipstick**, that too from *shady people like you*?

The man shows a piece of paper. As you read it, you realize that what the man said was true. Yet, this is the first time you are reading this paper.

Me: Look, I have never seen this agreement before and I never signed it. Heck! There is no signature in this page, just my name. You are clearly taking money from me for something I have never done!

Man: Seems like you forgot, but I showed this when you were being pickpocketed the first time. It's your fault that you did not read it. I had it in my hand all the time while I was taking out your wallet. You could have stopped me.

Me: There is no way I could have read that, you did not show it to me properly. You are charging me for an agreement I never agreed to. **STOP THIS. NOW!**

Man: If you want to stop me from doing this, talk to my master.

Me: Tell me how to meet your master. I want this stuff cancelled as soon as I meet him.

Man: Too bad, but my master cannot be reached. *For one, he does not exist anymore.*

Me: WTF? Then stop taking money from me. 

Man: Okay. It'll be done. Give me a small time.

You were robbed until you protested. Had you not, he could rob you forever. 

## What should I do with Reliance / Smart GSM? These guys practice their business essentially the same as the man above.

I bought their sim about a month earlier. I don't talk much on the phone. Maybe 2 - 3 short calls per day on an average. Did this triggered something in their network service? Low income? I started receiving promotional calls, daily, sometimes twice a day, from numbers in series `140138912X`. 

I hung them as these recorded calls wanted me to subscribe their 'stuff'. This only bothered me. I ignored them. I haven't signed for their 'Do not disturb' 'service' (which is again, a painful and long process). Today my phone was lying in a corner from the morning. I don't recall typing anything in it for the day. Then I got this message in the Inbox: 

> "Amount charged for VAS Osian SMS Pack Rs:20.00 Current Main Balance: Rs:2.31"

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/b2ps24I.jpg" width="400" />

WTF is that? I don't recall any pack by this name. Let alone doing something to subscribe it. They robbed Rs 20 from my pocket. (Google for more victims)

Another piggybacked message waiting in my inbox: 

> "You have been successfully subscribed to BeautyTips service for 20 days. To unsubscribe SMS Unsub 1530 to 155223 (Toll free)"

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/QI7BZuK.jpg" width="400" />

Not only my 20 rupees were taken, but I was automatically subscribed to something I never wanted. All this - without my permission. But they made it look like these were my actions. Shady.

Since Rs 20 is really a small amount for them and 20 days subscription - is like giving a demo. *Who cares! Just a small thing. Right?*

**Wrong!** If they can do this, they can easily make me a permanant subscriber of *anything* without my consent and start charging. This way, they will get money even I don't really use my phone for a month, unless I keep track of my inbox and notice incosisteies in how much I call and how much I'm charged.

The good thing is that at least I was able to unsubscribe - never expected to. 

I'll overlook this as it is the first time. Hope such auto-subscribed-money-gone incidents will not occur again.

Now excuse me - I have to recharge my phone again!

### <a id="har"> So </a>I got this SMS the very next day, i.e. today on Jan 26 


<img src="http://i.imgur.com/If2lXJu.jpg" width=400/>

So now I can either 

1. complain
2. break the sim altogether

I want to complain, but I'm not sure. I'll have to go to the culprits themselves. This company is real cheap and low. They intentionally do this.
