Update: <a href="#har">They harassed again, very next day.</a>

### What should I do with Reliance / Smart GSM? These guys practice their business essentially the same as a robber.

I bought their sim about a month earlier. I don't talk much on the phone. Maybe 2 - 3 short calls per day on an average. Did this triggered something in their network service? Low income? I started receiving promotional calls, daily, sometimes twice a day, from numbers in series `140138912X`. 

I hung them as these recorded calls wanted me to subscribe their 'stuff'. This only bothered me. I ignored them. I haven't signed for their 'Do not disturb' 'service' (which is again, a painful and long process). Today my phone was lying in a corner from the morning. I don't recall typing anything in it for the day. Then I got this message in the Inbox: 

> "Amount charged for VAS Osian SMS Pack Rs:20.00 Current Main Balance: Rs:2.31"

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/b2ps24I.jpg" width="400" />

WTF is that? I don't recall any pack by this name. Let alone doing something to subscribe it. They robbed Rs 20 from my pocket. (Google for more victims)

Another piggybacked message waiting in my inbox: 

> "You have been successfully subscribed to BeautyTips service for 20 days. To unsubscribe SMS Unsub 1530 to 155223 (Toll free)"

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/QI7BZuK.jpg" width="400" />

Not only my 20 rupees were taken, but I was automatically subscribed to something I never wanted. All this - without my permission. But they made it look like these were my actions. Shady.

Since Rs 20 is really a small amount for them and 20 days subscription - is like giving a demo. *Who cares! Just a small thing. Right?*

**Wrong!** If they can do this, they can easily make me a permanant subscriber of *anything* without my consent and start charging. This way, they will get money even I don't really use my phone for a month, unless I keep track of my inbox and notice incosisteies in how much I call and how much I'm charged.

The good thing is that at least I was able to unsubscribe - never expected to. 

I'll overlook this as it is the first time. Hope such auto-subscribed-money-gone incidents will not occur again.

Now excuse me - I have to recharge my phone again!

### <a name="har"> So </a>I got this SMS the very next day, i.e. today on Jan 26 

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/If2lXJu.jpg" width="400" />

I can either 

1. complain
2. break the sim altogether

I want to complain, but I'm not sure. I'll have to go to the culprits themselves. This company is real cheap and low. They intentionally do this.
