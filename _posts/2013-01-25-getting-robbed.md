### Imagine that you are living in a lawless world. 

One fine day, you were walking through a *really* crowded place. You had a wallet. Inside it, a Rs 20 note. Someone pickpocketed you. It all happened in a flash. Before you were back in senses - it was too late to do anything about it.

Next month, the same day, you go through the exact same place. A man confronts you, blocks your way, points a gun on your head, takes out your wallet, picks up Rs 20 and escapes. You were helpless again but this time you came to know the guy.

Come next month, the same situation occours at the same place. This time you are ready with Rs 20 in your hand. The man shows up. You hand him Rs 20.

You realize that this can not go on forever. The two things are bugging you the most  "Why is he taking money?", "How can I stop this?" 

You gather some courage and question the man.

You: Why do you taking my money forcibly?

Man: Because you made a deal. Remember? You have an agreement with my master that **you** will receive an __imported lipstick__ from him every month. In return you have to hand me Rs 20 monthly. Like or not, I'll keep taking that amount from you.

You: Wait, WHAT?? I don't remember such an agreement and I'm not even a woman!!! Why the eff I'd need a **lipstick**, that too from *shady people like you*?

The man shows a piece of paper. As you read it, you realize that what the man said was true. Yet, this is the first time you are reading this paper.

Me: Look, I have never seen this agreement before and I never signed it. Heck! There is no signature in this page, just my name. You are clearly taking money from me for something I have never done!

Man: Seems like you forgot but I showed this when you were being pickpocketed the first time. It's your fault that you did not read it. I had it in my hand all the time while I was taking out your wallet. You could have stopped me.

Me: WTF? There was no way I could read that, you did not show it to me properly. You are charging me for an agreement I never agreed to. STOP THIS. NOW!

Man: If you want to stop me from doing this, talk to my master.

Me: Tell me how to meet your master. I want this stuff cancelled as soon as I meet him.

Man: Too bad, but my master cannot be reached. For one, he does not exist anymore.

Me: WTF? Then stop taking money from me.
