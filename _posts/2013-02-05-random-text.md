# ABCD

I applaud the work and appreciate what you and the Subtlepatterns guys are doing. Thank you!

I do have a plea to users of some of these backgrounds. Perhaps I am a tinge obsessive compulsive, but the backgrounds that include uneven specks always make me think I have dust on my monitor that I need to wipe off. So when making a selection, might I ask you to choose a regular pattern rather than ones that are intended to look like spotty paper fiber? That is, of course, unless you are a paper products company. :)

Yes, pixel noise can be annoying. But it can be easily removed with a couple of clicks in Photoshop. Even simply resizing the pattern to 50% (some of the patterns are HUGE, and do you really need Retina resolution in your background texture?) will get rid of most pixel noise. Subtle Patterns are licensed under CC-BY-SA, so you can modify them as you see fit. It would be cool if OP's tool had the option to apply a few simple transformations to the patterns, such as CSS background-size.
