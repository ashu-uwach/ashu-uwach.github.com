This is the new layout for the blog. Unlike the previous, this one is dark. 

Often I read the kindle app while going to sleep. When the room is lit off it really helps to have a dark background and text in some darker shade of grey. Hence the inspiration for the dark theme comes from there.

The width of content is 480px and the text lines are 380px wide. This was done with mobiles in mind. Again, this means less characters per line and improves readability, but you have to scroll more ;). The blog looks good enough in IE9, a bit different from Chrome but not shabby in any way - likewise in android browser, which I have in my phone.

Opera Mini is unable to render title at all but the blog is still usable. I have not tried any other browser yet. College Lab seems to be best place to do that.

Next task would be to include facebook comments, making hyperlinks look better, and then taking some feedback from friends.
